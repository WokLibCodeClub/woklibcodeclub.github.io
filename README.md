# Github pages of Wokingham Library Code Club

These are projects we have used with 9-12 year old children at our Code Club in Wokingham, UK.

We code using Scratch and Python mainly, with some of the Python projects based on the PyGame Zero library.

The projects in this github are mostly Python:

* ### OnlineCodeclub 

In common with many other Code Clubs we shifted our activities online during the Coronavirus lockdown. We ran sessions twice a month each session consisting of a Scratch tutorial and a Python tutorial. We made video summaries of these sessions and put them on YouTube. This repository contains the links to all the summary videos. You can follow the projects through if you want.

* ### Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Turtles

Several of our young coders have worked on the Rock, Paper, Scissors Python project offered by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, but their version is entirely text based. This version is graphical, and uses turtles to show the different hand shapes. The final version lets the user select which hand shape to play by clicking on turtles. 

* ### Python-clock

The clock in our classroom broke down - actually it only needed a new battery, but it was an excuse to use Python to develop a clock. There are two clocks, both using turtles: a digital clock where a turtle writes the time, then an analogue with turtles for the moving hands.

The instructions are in this project, but there are lots of gaps where the coder needs to work out how to make the clock work properly.

* ### LetterA

This is a very detailed introduction to Pygame Zero, going in small steps through the process of displaying and moving a text box around the screen. It develops into a game for two players at one computer, with letters chasing each other around the screen.

* ### Snake

This is a development of the LetterA project, using Pygame Zero to produce a string of letters which follow each other around the screen like a snake. There is a lot on Python lists in this project. (At the time of writing - Feb 2020 - the last few stages still need to be completed.)

* ### breakout

This project recreates the 1970s arcade game using Pygame Zero. It builds up the code in small steps, introducing new Pygame Zero commands one at a time.

* ### froggit

This is a Pygame Zero frog chasing game, but the instructions are rather sparse, and there's not a lot of explanation about what each part of the game does. It makes extensive use of functions calling other functions, and is tricky to find your way around.

* ### rocket

This is a Pygame Zero space zapping game, again with rather sparse instructions. Not for beginners.
