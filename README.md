# Github pages of Wokingham Library Code Club

These are projects we have used with 9-12 year old children at our Code Club in Wokingham, UK.

We code using Scratch and Python mainly, with some of the Python projects based on the PyGame Zero library.

The repositories in this github are mostly Python but there are many Scratch projects in the OnlineCodeclub section:

* ### [Online Code Club](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub) 

In common with many other Code Clubs we shifted our activities online during the Coronavirus restrictions. We ran sessions twice a month, with a Scratch tutorial and a Python tutorial each session. We made video summaries of these sessions and put them on YouTube. This repository contains the links to all the summary videos. You can follow the projects through if you want.

* ### [Our Website](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OurWebsite) 

During our period of operating online we devoted some sessions to very basic HTML programming, and developing a very simple website. In this repository you can have a look at the different .html files we built up, and also look at how these would look on a real live website by following the link.

* ### [Using Pygame Zero](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Using-Pygame-Zero) 

Here you will find instructions on how to install PygameZero on your computer and incorporate it into your Python projects.

* ### [Install Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Install-Python) 

These are some (rather out of date) instructions for installing a version of Python on your own computer.

* ### [Rock Paper Scissors with Turtles](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Turtles) 

Several of our young coders have worked on the [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors) Python project offered by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, but their version is entirely text based. This version is graphical, and uses turtles to show the different hand shapes. The final version lets the user select which hand shape to play by clicking on turtles. 

* ### [Python Clock (two versions)](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Python-Clock) 

The clock in our classroom broke down - actually it only needed a new battery, but it was an excuse to use Python to develop a clock. There are two clocks, both using turtles: a digital clock where a turtle writes the time, then an analogue with turtles for the moving hands.

The instructions are in this project, but there are lots of gaps where the coder needs to work out how to make the clock work properly.

* ### [Space Race](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/SpaceRace)

This is a Python programme based on an old arcade game. The player has to control a rocket and move it from the bottom to the top of the screen while avoiding asteroids which are coming from left and right. The asteroids and the rocket are Python turtles. The instructions show how to build up the game using trinket, but the same code will work in any Python editor.

* ### [Hangman](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hangman)

This is a Python version of the word-guessing game Hangman, which is more than 100 years old (but before computers were invented people had to play using paper and pencil). The instructions show how to build up the game using trinket; the code will work in other Python editors, except that the clear screen function does not act in exactly the same way in every editor.

* ### [Lette rA](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/LetterA)

This is a very detailed introduction to Pygame Zero, going in small steps through the process of displaying and moving a text box around the screen. It develops into a game for two players at one computer, with letters chasing each other around the screen.

* ### [Word Snake](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/WordSnake)

This is a development of the LetterA project, using Pygame Zero to produce a string of letters which follow each other around the screen like a snake. There is a lot on Python lists in this project. (At the time of writing - Aug 2022 - the instructions for the last few stages have yet to be completed.)

* ### [Breakout](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/breakout)

This project recreates the 1970s arcade game using Pygame Zero. It builds up the code in small steps, introducing new Pygame Zero commands one at a time.

* ### [Froggit](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/froggit)

This is a Pygame Zero frog chasing game, but the instructions are rather sparse, and there's not a lot of explanation about what each part of the game does. It makes extensive use of functions calling other functions, and is tricky to find your way around.

* ### [Rocket](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/rocket)

This is a Pygame Zero space zapping game, again with rather sparse instructions. Not for beginners.

* ### [Traffic Lights, Crossroads and Cars](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Traffic-Lights-Crossroads-and-Cars)

This is an advanced Scratch project to use programmed traffic lights to control the flow of traffic across a junction.

* ### [Scratch Challenges](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Scratch-Challenges)

Here you will find a series of challenges to encourage smart Scratch coding. You will have to be clever in your use of loops to solve these!

* ### [Modular or Clock Arithmetic](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Modular-arithmetic)

As you develop your Python coding you will find that one of the most useful operators is the `%` or mod division operator. This section explains what it does, how to use it and gives some code examples where you can cut out loads of lines of code by using this operator.
